# London-s-Airbnb-Analysis
The project analyzed over 10,000 Airbnb listings in London to uncover trends in pricing, demand, and room types. Key factors such as proximity to iconic landmarks (Big Ben, Tower of London, Buckingham Palace) and their impact on pricing and occupancy were examined.
The study revealed how distance from central locations affects rental rates and booking frequency, with closer properties commanding higher prices and occupancy rates. 
Additionally, the analysis highlighted differences in average prices for room types (entire homes, private rooms, and shared spaces), offering insights for both hosts and guests.
Created geospatial visualizations to map property locations, showing price trends and occupancy rates relative to key landmarks.
