Project Overview


This project analyzes over 10,000 Airbnb listings in London to uncover key trends in pricing, demand, and room types. The analysis explores how proximity to iconic landmarks such as Big Ben, Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace influences rental rates and occupancy. The study provides valuable insights for both Airbnb hosts and guests, offering recommendations to optimize pricing strategies and location-based decisions.

Key Insights

Landmark Proximity & Pricing:

Listings closer to major landmarks (within 1 km) are priced 35% higher compared to those farther away. Properties near Big Ben, Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace command a premium, driving greater demand and higher occupancy.


Distance & Occupancy:
Properties within 3 km of central landmarks have an 85% occupancy rate, while those located more than 5 km away have only a 60% occupancy rate.

Geospatial Visualizations:
Geospatial visualizations were created to map the location of properties, displaying price trends and occupancy rates relative to the proximity of key landmarks. These visualizations help to better understand the geographic distribution of Airbnb listings in London.

Technologies Used

Data Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau/Power BI

Geospatial Mapping: Folium, Geopandas

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)

Objectives

Provide actionable insights to Airbnb hosts on how to optimize pricing based on location and room type.
