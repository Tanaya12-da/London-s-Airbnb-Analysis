# London-s-Airbnb-Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores over 10,000 Airbnb listings in London to uncover key trends and insights into pricing, demand, and room types. By examining factors such as proximity to iconic landmarks (Big Ben, Tower of London, Buckingham Palace), the analysis highlights how location influences rental rates and occupancy.

Key findings include the effect of distance from central landmarks on pricing and booking frequency, differences in average prices for various room types, and the development of geospatial visualizations to map these insights.

Key Objectives
Analyze Trends: Study pricing, occupancy, and demand across different areas in London.
Location Impact: Assess the influence of proximity to landmarks on rental performance.
Room Type Insights: Compare pricing and demand for entire homes, private rooms, and shared spaces.
Geospatial Visualizations: Visualize property data and trends on interactive maps.
Key Insights
Proximity and Pricing: Properties within 1 km of iconic landmarks command an average price 35% higher than those farther away.
Room Type Trends: Entire homes average £150/night, private rooms £80/night, and shared spaces £40/night.
Occupancy Rates: Listings within 3 km of landmarks have an 85% occupancy rate compared to 60% beyond 5 km.
Geospatial Mapping: Created interactive maps showcasing price trends, occupancy, and property locations relative to landmarks.
